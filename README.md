## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I have learned how Event Delegation can be used to efficiently add events to many elements without compromising any performance. Other thing i used is the object element to add an SVG into the page

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<object data="" type=""></object>
```

```js
Event Delegation and its Bubbling phase

```

### Continued development

In future projects, i want to improve my DOM manipulation skills by using Events and its event object and utilize debugging and developer skills efficiently.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://javascript.info/event-delegation) - This helped me for Event Delegation. I really liked their explantion and will refer it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) - This is an amazing website which helped me use modern JS tools instead of relying on jquery. I'd recommend it to anyone who is using jquery.
